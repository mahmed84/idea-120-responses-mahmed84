In Nakamura’s citation of Lev Manovich, he talks about tiktok, which is the most trending thing on the internet today with billions of daily users and subscribers. Tiktok is a communication/interaction platform, where people from all over the world make short/long videos of themselves doing random things. People can subscribe, message, share, conduct live chats/broadcasts etc, to gain fame and popularity and through this many people earn their bread and butter. 

The best part of this app is that it is user friendly, it doesn’t have any parental control. It is approved by the PG board for ages 3+. It is a free app available for download through the world, which means people from any race, age, color, religion use it and try to gain fame and publicize themselves. It has some really weird and stupid content for entertainment purposes but then it also has some really informative content where we can find out a lot about people from different races, country religion etc. This app has had a huge impact on the youth of today and that too all around the world, every person owning a smartphone, tablet or a laptop have either seen some tiktok videos or maybe even made them. It is an app that the developers are really proud of as they gave the world an open platform to communicate and publicize themselves in the entire world.
