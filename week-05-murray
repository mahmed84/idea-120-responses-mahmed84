Given that we live in the 21st century with rapid advancements in the world of technology, I believe that Murray’s prediction of a virtual living environment with internet and tv came to be true. 
These advancements recently came in the span of the last twenty years where we got devices such as the Nintendo Wii, the Nintendo switch, Xbox Kinect, smart TV’s, smart phones, virtual reality consoles that with the help of chips and programming lets us control the devices at our own will with our hand gestures and so on. 
The Mandalorian actors performed a series of ritual and participatory acts indulged in virtual environments, this is an astonishing reference to Murrays prediction about the virtual living environment. 
The experiences that the actors and people from the production house go through is completely different and opposite to what the people from the outside world are seeing.
The people performing these acts and assisting in these acts are aware of the sets and the procedures that are needed to be done to make it virtual, whereas those who are watching these acts sees it as something extraordinary as after each and every scene the background changes, the props change, it’s a different set giving it a virtual experience making it a real eye pleaser to the crowd.
