A coded iconic message (creates a coherent message)

In my opinion, coded iconic message is still an image message, while non-coded iconic message is also an expression of text message.

In addition, I would like to know whether you received my Pull Requests? I should have sent you the invitation yesterday, but what I have shown here is still waiting for the invitation.

-- Great!
