According to Mona Chalabi, there are three ways to deal with poor statistics. Firstly, we have to figure out the uncertainty of information, if it is authentic or not. Secondly, we have to decide how we wanna gather information and thirdly, if we have all the needed information/data available in order to make the correct decisions. From the readings of Chris Gayomali, I deduced how a lot of people's feelings, impressions and moods can be affected by the style of font being used and through the different ways of typing. Through Cathy O neil's reading, I saw how these advertising companies target different people on the basis of their spending cycle, how they through predatory targeting, place products on certain groups and also on the Internet as a whole. 
However. I think targeted advertising, using certain demographics/interests for interaction has made the internet a very useful and resourceful place. Given the current market situation, many people prefer buying online rather than going and searching for things. People can search whatever that interests them and the internet will show them related results, giving people the best possible alternative. This also has a downside, which is often people are misguided, they dont have accurate enough information and due to that they aren't able to differentiate between whats real or fake on the internet.
