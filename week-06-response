I completely agree with the ideologies of Bridle and the problems he identified. The impacts of systemization and automation are far beyond our thinking. It is something that has affected the new generation greatly and deeply. In the time of our fathers and forefathers, systemization and automation were controlled, people still did most of their work themselves but given how fast the world has evolved into a completely systematic and automated world, we have robots to do our everyday choirs, we have cars that drive themselves, we have smartphones with artificial intelligence. These things are deeply affecting children, they have no physical exercise, everything they do revolves around systemization and automation. It is harmful for their brains, it denies them the ability to do critical thinking. They lack the knowledge that can only be learnt through doing things.
