A game is a game only by the rules that they consist of, which means that while playing a game the experience is brought out by abiding to the rules and hints put in by game developers for a more realistic experience of the game. 

A game is much more than just experience, a game could be a story of a certain character, it could be a story, it could be based on real events, it could be a sci-fi game, it could be someone’s fantasy that came to life in the form of a game. It is about how indulge we are into the game that makes us live everything that happens in a game to the fullest. 

Something that makes a video game even better are the plug-ins. A plug-in is something that creates a balance between rules of the game. It doesn’t let a gamer enjoy the best game experience but then it also doesn’t let the developer enjoy the benefits of the game. So according to what I believe, a good game needs plug-ins in order for it to emerge as a good game and it also helps in the monitoring of the gaming environment.
