Every game created either gives out a bad vibe or a good vibe, meaning it could either have a negative impact on someone or maybe a positive one, depending on a lot of factors of the game. 

In my opinion, a good game consists of good graphics, a narrative storytelling, plot twisters, an amazing gameplay, music, screenplay, visibility and so on and so forth. While a person is playing a game, they should feel like they are in the game, experiencing everything and being very indulged into things. 

Being a creator of the game means that we have the power to, visualize things, collect data, conduct an analysis to improve the game according to the needs of the game. 

However, the creator of the game and an editor of the game canâ€™t ever create a good game, each person has a specific role while creating a game, if their roles switch out or something then that means that they would be creating a bad game. A collective effort by the entire team always makes the best video games.
